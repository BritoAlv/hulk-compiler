## Semantic Requirements:
- errors are wrong due to corrupt ast.
- for to while ruins error report.
- explicit vector corruption ruins semantic check.
## CodeGen Requirements:
- Compare strings (equality) char by char.
- RunTime Error for overflow.
- Implement Random function.
- Add to the environment the program.hulk
